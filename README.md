# Arsenal_Footballer_Data_Generator

When you see a photo of a football player, it may not be known who he is. A dataset has been created for a model that can be developed to find out who it is. For now, only the names of Arsenal FC players who played in the 2021-2022 and 2020-2021 seasons were obtained from the dataset [worldfootball.net](https://www.worldfootball.net/players_list/eng-premier-league-2021-2022/nach-name/1/). Photos of football players were downloaded from google images by web scraping from the names obtained and a dataset was created. Scripts that allow creating datasets with a total of 47 players and using BeautifulSoap and Selenium libraries are shared in this repository. Sample images from the created dataset are shared below.
